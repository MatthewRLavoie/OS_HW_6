Q1. Copy-On-Write (COW) is a memory optimization technique used during the fork() system call to reduce latency when creating a new process. Instead of immediately duplicating all memory pages from the parent process to the child, COW allows both processes to initially share the same physical memory pages marked as read-only. If either process attempts to write to a shared page, the operating system creates a separate copy of that page for the writing processâ€”a mechanism known as "copy-on-write." This approach significantly improves performance because it avoids unnecessary copying of memory, especially when the child process does not modify most of the parent's memory or immediately calls exec() to load a new program. By deferring memory duplication until itâ€™s absolutely necessary, COW makes fork() much faster and more efficient, especially for processes with large address spaces.

Q2. Process* fork_process(Process* parent) {
    Process* child = create_new_process();

    for each page in parent->address_space {
        // Mark both parent and child page tables as read-only and COW
        if (page.is_writable) {
            set_page_flags(parent->page_table, page.vaddr, READ_ONLY | COW);
            set_page_flags(child->page_table, page.vaddr, READ_ONLY | COW);
        }

        // Share the same physical page
        child->page_table[page.vaddr] = parent->page_table[page.vaddr];

        // Increase reference count on the shared physical page
        increment_refcount(page.physical_page);
    }

    return child;
}

void page_fault_handler(Address addr, Process* proc) {
    PageTableEntry* entry = proc->page_table[addr];

    if (entry.flags contains COW) {
        PhysicalPage* old_page = entry.physical_page;

        if (get_refcount(old_page) > 1) {
            // Shared page: make a private copy
            PhysicalPage* new_page = allocate_new_page();
            copy_page_contents(old_page, new_page);
            proc->page_table[addr] = new_page;
            set_page_flags(proc->page_table, addr, WRITABLE);
            decrement_refcount(old_page);
        } else {
            // Only one reference: just make it writable
            set_page_flags(proc->page_table, addr, WRITABLE);
        }
    } else {
        // Handle non-COW faults (not shown here)
    }
}

void free_process_memory(Process* proc) {
    for each page in proc->page_table {
        PhysicalPage* phys = page.physical_page;
        decrement_refcount(phys);

        if (get_refcount(phys) == 0) {
            free_physical_page(phys);
        }

        unmap_page(proc->page_table, page.vaddr);
    }
}
